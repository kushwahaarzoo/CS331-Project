1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to formally specify the requirements for the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Platform.
This platform aims to automate the detection, analysis, and response to cybersecurity incidents by integrating multiple security tools and executing predefined response workflows.

1.2 Scope

The SOAR platform will:

Collect security alerts from multiple sources

Correlate and prioritize incidents

Automate incident response actions

Provide dashboards and reports for security teams

Reduce manual effort and response time during security incidents

The system is intended for use by Security Analysts, SOC teams, and System Administrators.

1.3 Definitions and Acronyms

SOAR: Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response

SOC: Security Operations Center

Incident: A security event requiring investigation or response

Playbook: A predefined automated response workflow

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

The SOAR platform is a centralized security automation system that integrates with existing security tools such as:

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Firewalls

SIEM tools

Endpoint Security Systems

It acts as an orchestration layer on top of these tools.

2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
User Type	Description
Security Analyst	Monitors alerts, investigates incidents
SOC Manager	Reviews reports and incident trends
System Administrator	Manages system configuration and integrations
2.3 Operating Environment

Web-based application

Runs on cloud or on-premise infrastructure

Supports modern web browsers

Backend hosted on Linux-based servers

2.4 Design Constraints

Must ensure secure handling of sensitive security data

Must support role-based access control

Should be scalable for large volumes of alerts

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Alert Ingestion

The system shall collect alerts from multiple security tools.

The system shall support API-based and log-based alert ingestion.

The system shall normalize incoming alerts into a standard format.

3.2 Incident Management

The system shall group related alerts into a single incident.

The system shall assign severity levels to incidents.

The system shall allow analysts to manually update incident status.

3.3 Automation Playbooks

The system shall allow users to define automated response playbooks.

The system shall execute playbooks based on incident type and severity.

The system shall support conditional logic in playbooks.

3.4 Automated Response Actions

The system shall block malicious IP addresses automatically.

The system shall isolate compromised endpoints.

The system shall send notifications via email or messaging platforms.

3.5 Dashboard and Visualization

The system shall provide a real-time incident dashboard.

The system shall display alert statistics and response timelines.

The system shall allow filtering incidents by severity and date.

3.6 Reporting

The system shall generate incident response reports.

The system shall export reports in PDF or CSV format.

The system shall maintain historical incident data.

3.7 User Management

The system shall support user authentication.

The system shall implement role-based access control.

The system shall log all user activities for auditing.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance

The system shall process alerts with minimal latency.

The system shall support concurrent users without degradation.

4.2 Security

The system shall encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

The system shall log all security-related actions.

The system shall prevent unauthorized access.

4.3 Reliability

The system shall be available 24/7.

The system shall recover gracefully from failures.

4.4 Scalability

The system shall scale horizontally to handle increased alert volume.

The system shall support integration with new security tools.

4.5 Usability

The system shall provide an intuitive user interface.

The system shall minimize manual intervention during incidents.

5. Assumptions and Dependencies
5.1 Assumptions

Integrated security tools expose APIs or logs.

Users have basic knowledge of cybersecurity concepts.

5.2 Dependencies

Availability of third-party security tools

Network connectivity for integrations

6. Future Enhancements

AI-based incident prioritization

Machine learning–driven anomaly detection

Automated threat intelligence enrichment

7. Conclusion

The SOAR platform aims to improve security operations efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, reducing response time, and enhancing visibility into security incidents.
