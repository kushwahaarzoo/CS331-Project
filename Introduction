Introduction

With the increasing complexity and frequency of cyber threats, organizations deploy multiple security tools such as intrusion detection systems, log management platforms, firewalls, and email security solutions to protect their infrastructure. However, these tools generate a large volume of security alerts that often require manual analysis and response, leading to delayed actions and inconsistent incident handling.

The Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform presented in this project provides a centralized solution for automating security operations. The system integrates alerts from multiple security sources, normalizes and analyzes them using rule-based logic, and executes predefined response playbooks automatically. Key features of the platform include centralized alert management, automated incident response, playbook-driven workflows, threat intelligence validation, real-time notifications, and comprehensive logging and audit trails. A web-based dashboard offers clear visibility into security events and response actions.

By reducing manual intervention and standardizing security responses, the proposed SOAR platform improves incident response efficiency, consistency, and overall security management.

Purpose of this document.
The purpose of this document is to formally specify the requirements for the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Platform.
This platform aims to automate the detection, analysis, and response to cybersecurity incidents by integrating multiple security tools and executing predefined response workflows.

Scope of the Application
The SOAR platform will:
Collect security alerts from multiple sources
Correlate and prioritize incidents
Automate incident response actions
Provide dashboards and reports for security teams
Reduce manual effort and response time during security incidents
The system is intended for use by Security Analysts, SOC teams, and System Administrators.
