# Q2. Business Rules, Validation Logic, and Data Transformation

## A) Business Rules Implementation

Business rules define how the system processes data and performs operations.

### Implemented Business Rules

1. Authentication Rule
   - Only valid users can log in
   - Token-based authentication is enforced

2. Threat Detection Rule
   - If an IP exists in threat intelligence database, it is marked as malicious

3. Alert Severity Rule
   - High severity alerts trigger immediate response actions
   - Low severity alerts are logged for monitoring

4. Playbook Rule
   - If alert type is phishing, email quarantine is triggered
   - If IP is malicious, blocking action is executed

5. Notification Rule
   - Critical alerts generate notifications to users or administrators

6. Access Control Rule
   - Only authorized users can perform administrative actions

## B) Validation Logic

Validation ensures correctness and consistency of data entering the system.

### Implemented Validation Logic

1. User Input Validation
   - Username and password must not be empty
   - Password must meet required length

2. API Request Validation
   - Required fields must be present
   - Data types must be correct

3. Database Validation
   - Unique constraints on username
   - Data integrity maintained

4. Security Validation
   - Token validation for protected routes
   - Prevention of unauthorized access

### Example

if not username or not password:
    return "Invalid Input"

## C) Data Transformation

Data transformation converts raw database data into a format suitable for the user interface.

### Implementation

1. Backend Transformation
   - Converts database records into JSON format
   - Filters and structures relevant fields

2. Frontend Mapping
   - Maps API responses into UI components
   - Displays data in tables and dashboards

3. Data Formatting
   - Converts timestamps into readable format
   - Renames fields for better readability

### Example

Database format:
{
  "alert_id": 1,
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "severity": "high"
}

UI format:
{
  "IP Address": "192.168.1.1",
  "Severity": "High Alert"
}

## Summary

Business rules are implemented using conditional logic in backend modules. Validation logic ensures that input data is correct and secure. Data transformation ensures that data from the database is converted into a structured and user-friendly format for the presentation layer.
