# Overview
This project is on SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) in the domain of cyber security. The purpose is implement a system that automatically integrates, streamlines, and automates security operations. It will manage, analyze, and respond to threats automatically or through orchestrated playbooks, reducing manual workload, enhancing response times, and improving overall security. 

# What is SOAR
Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions help integrate and automate security operations, to reduce manual work and enable fast threat response. It employs automation to reduce complexity and increase the effectiveness of incident response.

## What Does SOAR Stand For?
### Security
The security aspect of SOAR covers the machine-based security tasks. Traditionally, organizations handled much of their security burden in-house, with security teams performing these tasks manually. And here comes SOAR for increasing the speed and quality of security processes to keep up with modern business demands and schedules. Security orchestration refers to coordinating security-related actions such as incident investigation and response. Security automation is the use of machines to execute these actions. Security response is a unified framework for security teams to plan and manage their response to threats.

### Orchestration
Orchestration is the second component of SOAR. Orchestration is the machine-based coordination of a series of interdependent security actions, including incident investigation, response and ultimately resolution, all across a single, complex infrastructure. It ensures that all of your security and non-security tools are working together in unison whether automating tasks across workflows or manually alerting agents on important incidents that need more attention.

### Automation
Automation is the third building block of SOAR and is important for using security tools efficiently. A major challenge for many security application is to perform the numerous repetitive, manual tasks involved in security processes. It will generate threat message, but the security feeds will still generate tens or hundreds of false positives that require investigation. SOAR automates this process by checking alerts against specified rules that help distinguish between legitimate events and false positives. Automating these tedious, repetitive tasks helps unburden the security team and improves its overall performance.

### Response
Response is the final aspect of SOAR. In addition to helping other security tools identify threats, SOAR can respond to cybersecurity threats, removing them from the network. This function involves a collaborative process where the SOAR solution works with other tools to contain and eradicate malicious actors.

## Key Benefits and Use Cases
Faster incident response: By automating incident response operations and cutting down on the time needed to detect and address security incidents, security orchestration helps security teams respond to incidents more swiftly. 

Enhanced cooperation: By offering a consolidated perspective of security operations, security orchestration platforms facilitate easier information sharing and better teamwork between various teams. 

Improved visibility: Security teams can identify and address threats more skillfully because of security orchestration, which gives them a thorough picture of security events and incidents throughout an organization’s network. 

Decreased manual tasks: Security orchestration automates manual tasks, relieving security personnel of some of their workload and freeing them to concentrate on more difficult assignments. 

Threat Hunting: Handling the flood of alerts, leaving them little time to hunt for, response to threats. Automated threat response deals with many incidents without manual intervention, freeing the security team to work on long-term security strategies and high-profile threats.

Notification : Giving the information about various attacks and bloking the ips deleting the message and showing it on dashboard and sending the text/email message.
